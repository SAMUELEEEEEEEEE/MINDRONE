# PROJECT AND GROUP DESCRIPTION

Our project is thought for people suffering from ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) or multiple sclerosis and allow them to visit museums directly from their home through a drone called Tello. For people suffering from ASL that, in most cases, in advanced states of the disease, the patient can't move any muscle. He can continue to use the power of the brain concentration and we catch brain waves through a device called Muse2. After receiving a minimum signal of concentration, the drone rises and follows a pre-set path, in which it scans the qr code and shows the corresponding image of a certain artistic work.
