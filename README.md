# PROJECT AND GROUP DESCRIPTION

Our project is thought for people suffering from ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) or multiple sclerosis and allow them to visit museums directly from their home through a drone called Tello. For people suffering from ASL that, in most cases, in advanced states of the disease, the patient can't move any muscle. He can continue to use the power of the brain concentration and we catch brain waves through a device called Muse2. After receiving a minimum signal of concentration, the drone rises and follows a pre-set path, in which it scans the qr code and shows the corresponding image of a certain artistic work. While, if users are people suffering from multiple sclerosis and they can move neck muscles, they can activate a second mode based on the movements of the neck to manage the direction of the drone in museums. It's been everything done through python.

Our group is composed of five members: Giraudo Giacomo, Leardi Ludovico, Menardi Samuele, Pellegrino Gabriele and Serra Alberto.At the beginning we chose the leader, Menardi Samuele, and subsequently we divided various task:
Giraudo Giraudo worked on Tello drone with Pellegrino Gabriele
Leardi Ludovico worked on Leap sensor whith Serra Alberto
Menardi Samuele worked on Muse2 
Pellegrino Gabriele worked on Tello drone with Giraudo Giraudo
Serra Alberto worked on Leap sensor whith Leardi Ludovico
The next days Leardi and Serra decided to abort the work on the leap sensor casue the high amount of sensors to use.in case of problems we have decided to work together so that we can solve it easily
